# Fuel Route

> **Demonstration:** this is a demonstration site for a fictional business. Its name, prices, hours and contact details are invented and must not be used.

Live site: https://ma-za-kpe.github.io/fuel-route/

Built and published by Yard Crew from an approved brief. The pages are in
`app/`; your business content is in `app/content.json`.

## Changing content

Your business content is in one file, `app/content.json`: each entry is one fact
from your brief, exactly as the pages show it. The pages read it, so you
never edit HTML or code to change a price, a time or a sentence.

- `"F1": "Status: a product concept shown as a demonstration, not a live service"`
- `"F2": "Who it is for: Logistics and real estate teams and customers in Ethiopia"`

- Problem it explores, as described by StartupTribunal research: Ethiopian Fuel Supply Blocked Without Petroleum Pipeline: not in the content file (the pages do not show it word for word); ask the crew to change it.
- Research status: rejected by the StartupTribunal AI Tribunal, published with caveats.: not in the content file (the pages do not show it word for word); ask the crew to change it.
- Research by StartupTribunal: https://startuptribunal.com/catalog/ethiopian-fuel-supply-blocked-without-petroleum-pipeline: not in the content file (the pages do not show it word for word); ask the crew to change it.

To change a value:

1. On GitHub, open `app/content.json`, choose Edit, and change only the text in
   quotes after the fact's name. Keep the quotes, and the comma where there
   is one.
2. Commit it to a new branch and open a pull request.
3. CI checks the pull request: it builds the site, runs the frozen tests on
   every page, and `tests/test_content.py` checks that the file is valid JSON
   and still holds every fact the pages read.
4. When CI is green, merge it into `main`, then ask the crew for a release
   (see Publishing). The live site changes only then.

Your approved brief is checked too: `tests/test_brief.py` holds the numbers
and item names of each fact. A new price or time changes your brief, so CI
stays red until that fact's entry in `FACTS` in `tests/test_brief.py` (yours,
under CODEOWNERS) states the new numbers as well: change both in the same pull
request. Rewording that keeps the numbers and item names needs only the
content file. Phone, email and map links are in the pages themselves; ask the
crew to change those.

### Rolling back

Each release is tagged at the commit it published (`release-1`, `release-2`,
...; see Releases on GitHub). To return the content to an earlier release,
restore the content file and the brief tests from its tag on a new branch:

```
git checkout -b restore-content
git checkout release-1 -- app/content.json tests/test_brief.py
git commit -m "Restore content from release-1"
git push -u origin restore-content
```

or choose Revert on the merged pull request on GitHub. Either way, open the
pull request, let CI check it, merge it and ask the crew for a release. A
one-step rollback that re-publishes an earlier build without a pull request
is not available yet.

### Design

- Colours and spacing: the design tokens in `app/globals.css` lines 1–13.

## Checks that protect your site

- `python -m unittest discover -s tests` runs the frozen tests, including
  `tests/test_brief.py`, which come from your approved brief.
- `pre-commit install` once, so the same pinned hooks as CI run on every commit.
- CI also checks the page in a real browser at phone and desktop sizes, with
  automated accessibility checks.
- `tests/` belongs to you (CODEOWNERS): nobody edits it to make a change pass.
  CI and tooling (`.github/`) changes are approved by the crew's platform
  review and must keep every action pinned, the tests running and every job.

## Publishing

GitHub Pages serves the `gh-pages` branch. Yard Crew's trusted release builds
`main`'s exact commit after every required check passes on it, publishes that
build to `gh-pages`, checks the live page and tags the release. A merge to
`main` by itself does not update the live site: ask the crew for a release.

## Approving content

Read every price, time and contact detail on the live page before telling
customers about it. The crew states only what your brief gives; anything new
needs your approval first.

## Custom domain

Add your domain under Settings, Pages, Custom domain, then point a DNS CNAME
record at the GitHub Pages address.

## Analytics

No analytics or trackers are installed, so the site collects nothing about
visitors. Adding any is a privacy decision for you to make.

## Maintenance

The site is static: no server, database or secrets to patch. Keep the pinned
tool versions current through reviewed pull requests.
