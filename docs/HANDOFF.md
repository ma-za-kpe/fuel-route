## How to change content

The brief's facts live in `app/content.json`: change a value there and every page that shows it follows. Pages are under `app/`, the style is `app/globals.css` and the brand tokens are in `brand/tokens.css`.

Open a pull request; CI runs the frozen tests and the browser check on it.
